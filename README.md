[R] Exhaustive Search : Knapsack problem (brainless solution)

Following a Coursera course on optimisation I set up this exhaustive search algorithm in R. This is not a suitable way to deal with any real optimisation problem but the code is in my opinion quite elegant and the algorithm is perfect for addressing problems with a limited number of alternative options. The basic idea is to generate indicators for all possible solutions and then apply them consecutively.
